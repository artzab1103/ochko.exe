# Mini-history about this project
3-5 month ago i for a joke started making a virus, that called ochko.exe.

I make GDI with Maltoolkit1.0.exe, .bat/.vbs with Notepad++, BassBoosted .wav with Audacity.

I learn, how to create SFX Archive with WinRAR and i make my first harmless malware in my life.

I tested on Win 7 VM, works perfectly (GDI, .bat, .vbs), and i decided send geometry dash crack + rat one personðŸ˜ˆ (his name is Vanya)

I ratted with C03Packet, load this virus to his computer and started it: (GDI doesn't work because av issue)

I fixed some things and make first release. And i wanna make full recode to release on GitHub :)
